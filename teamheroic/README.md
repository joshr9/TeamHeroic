# What user experience considerations did you make with your solution / tradeoffs?
  While working on this test, I had to choose what information to display
  from the API. I chose, rank, the first and last name of the user,
  and their profileUrl. I felt that information was the most pertinent to see
  on a dynamic leaderboard.

  I also decided to cycle through the leaderboard in 5 second intervals.
  It gives the user enough time to read the 4 leaders that are being shown on
  the screen.

# What third party / open source libs did you use and why?
  I chose to use Angular Material, because after using the chrome tools to investigate
  the demo login you gave me, I saw that is how you build your web app. I wanted
  to match the design to your site.
